You have enough work experience I think you should put less emphasis on education. Move it to the bottom and remove GPA and course work.
"As a recruiter this resume is very hard for me to read. Please use a boring and basic formatting, those are the best.

In addition to that do the following.

* Every bullet point needs to be in past tense, even if you are still working there. 
* It's been a bit since I recruited for this particular position but I don't see any keywords that would help me with the exception of the 5th bullet as that is a solid one with good keywords. 
* Your bullet points need to be rewritten with keywords in mind. You need to have more bullets like the 5th one, as that is solid, but you do need to write the result of what you do. WHAT the skill is, HOW you used it, and what the RESULT of it was. 

Do the above, which is a lot honestly, and you should start seeing more success."
"- Switch to traditional resume template (Grayscale bars and fonts give the impression of outdated look regardless).

- Since you're switching careers in a sense, add relevant coursework to possibly hit some keywords

- Experience section to top, though if you have good courses maybe experiment with having Education on top?

- Listing OSs isn't really skills. What did you do within each OS - did you setup AD within windows, spun up Linux Kubernetes Clusters, etc?

- Same with AWS and Azure, each of them of have hundreds of services, which ones do you know and have worked with?

- For projects, get rid of the ""Description"" and just give a couple bullet points on what you did, reduce adjectives a little here as well (""precise penetration tests..."",""diverse threat vectors""). Some are good, but in this scenario, there are too many IMO, and it detracts from what you did/learned.

- You don't really need a location for the projects section

- There are a couple more smallish things, but the above changes should improve your resume quite a bit."
"In my eyes your Objective is superfluous. Your education and internship already provide information about your skillset and your career interests. 

Your front desk and counselor roles aren't as relevant to the work you're seeking to do, so you can say less about them. 1-2 bullet points. 

Attaining Eagle Scout level speaks for itself. Hiring managers will get it, you don't have to provide a description of the honor. If your service project is relevant to your professional interests, and you're proud to talk about it, you could describe that, to have a conversation-starter at the end of your resume."
Redesign this résumé into a functional resume and combine it with infographics. That's your best chance to securing more interview opportunities.
"please excuse the text formatting, I was trying to make me anonymous"
Put Education below that's my opinion
"Think of your resume as a Sales pamphlet. You need to give motivation to your recruiter to talk to you. Spend few minutes reading about the role and company. Update your resume by discussing something common between your profile and the role that the recruiter is compelled to talk to you. Focus on ""how you did it"" to those common points. If you have any target job in mind you can review and refine your resume for that job using tools like TalentGuide AI."
"Maybe an Objectives section, but it looks good."
"It's good! For some reason I would recommend you add a summary about: who you are, what you do, what are your strong foundations, what are your achievements, and what you seek (what you mostly liked to have an encounter)."
"I’m not In your of expertise, nor have I been a hiring manager, but at first glance, it looks like you have 3 pages for 12 years of professional experience, &amp; only list 8 of those In your summary. I am a veteran w/ 20+ years of experience, &amp; can still simplify it down to 1 page. 

Your entire first page needs to go, &amp; from a broad overview, each job should Only have 3-5 bullet points where your presence made a significant impact on the company’s bottom line. 

There is a bit of debate as to how long a resume should be, but provided what I’m seeing here, I believe you have some overkill."
"Hi,

I hope things are well.

I've noticed a few things about your resume that could use improvement. It's missing key points that set you apart from others in your field:

Lacks key metrics in your experience

Formatting isn't ATS friendly

Education should be at the bottom (you want your last job to be at the front)

I hope this helps. Thanks for allowing me to assist."
"Why on earth does it say Malaysian at the top?

Executive summary reads fine if a bit wordy. Cut it down or don’t, doesn’t matter too much. 

Key skills being centered to the page makes the spacing read a little weird in my opinion. Maybe try aligning to the right and putting some extra space between each skill to make them more readable.

First set of bullets is great. Love that you included the impact of your accomplishments and they appear impressive enough.

Second set loses me a bit. They don’t seem super relevant but maybe the position just isn’t as relevant to your career path. Try to include more specifics about your impact and any technologies used across all your bullets.

Everything after this, get rid of it. Or stuff it into one page. There’s no reason you should have a two page resume at this point, so find some way to cram it into one. Maybe remove some key skills, change font sizes, etc."
"Your resume needs a lot of changes.

  
- Get rid of those arrows! Having any sort of icon is KILLING your chance to get a job interview because humans aren't even seeing it because the computer (ATS system) is discarding it beforehand. Only use bullet points.

- Almost all of your bullet points are wrong. It's too much of ""what I've done at my job"" as opposed to ""what I've accomplished at my job"". Convert all those into a statistic or achievement or include some kind of number.

- Put a space between education and that bullet point above and even experience as they are too close to each other.

- Put a space between TripleTen and UC Berkeley

- If you haven't already, put your job title under your name"
"I posted my resume too and someone said change the coloured text to black.
Maybe you could try that too .
I'm not an expert."
"1. Your resume objective is TOO LONG!! Should only be 2-3 lines and should NOT include personal pronouns but rather start with a strong action word. But since you are relatively new you can scrap this section completely and start with your education listing relevant coursework.
2. Your resume is TOO LONG!! For your experience level it should NOT exceed one page. 
3. You have way too many bullets under your experiences and they’re not even good. Each bullet only talks about what you did. Each experience should include 3-5 bullet points all following the XYZ method (Action word “X” by doing “Y” resulting in “Z” outcome and this should be quantified as much as possible). This will help to bring your resume to one page
4. The indents are wrong points should NOT be indented 
5. No need to write “key responsibilities” recruiters know what your bullets are the format of a resume is pretty well known.
6. No need to write reference you can take that part take that out."
"Profile paragraph is ridiculous no one will even read 2 lines of that. 1-2 lines max

Indents are all wrong for second line statements 

3 pages for less than 4 years exp is crazy. Max 1 page resume until 10 years of exp

Way to much white spacing 

Education at the end"
"As far as your bullet points go, here are a few ideas on how to improve them:  
  
Include impact of your actions: Demonstrate how your actions made a difference. Did they improve efficiency, save money, or meet critical deadlines?  
  
Quantify achievements: Use numbers, percentages, and specific metrics to highlight your accomplishments. 

Highlight key skills and tools: Mention any specific project management methodologies, software, or tools you used."
FF. I'm also in the project management industry
"This is a wall of text - try and find a way to cull the superfluous information. Also, use UK English when applying for Australian roles, not US English."
"I'm in the US, so I'll only comment on visual. 
1. Make your opening shorter. I wouldn't read that hefty paragraph.
2. Compact your bullet points to make your whole resume shorter. You haven't been working long so there's no reason to have 3 pages to your resume.
3. Take the ""references available upon request"" off. That's understood."
Shorten your bullet points and try to get on one page
big wall of text
"You might want to condense your words a bit. They are often looking at many resumes so no one wants to read all that. Keep it short and sweet

Consider formatting as this or something similar:

COMPANY 

Role

2000 - 2002(smaller font size)
- skill and example
- skill and example

Have you checked out online resume templates yet? (There are good and bad ones avoid heavily formatted ones)"
Not gonna even read
Why did you decide to put your skills at the end of the CV? Your experience section is quite confusing to understand to me. I didn’t bother to read most of it because of this.
Not getting calls in spite of good background.
"As a recruiter, I am not sure what job titles you are aiming for, is it for Service Desk Technician?

To help see if this is good we need to know the job titles you are applying for since you need to make your resume for each job title."
"get rid of the personal statement, put that shit in a cover letter. 

don't center your job titles, just left-align them after the dates.

don't say stuff was online or remote, especially for your schooling, lots of people look down on online degrees.

it might be worth it to list job months since most of these positions are kinda short-term.

i think you should separate education and certification, it's a little confusing to read. you can do a 2-column deal and that might save some space if you're worried."
[removed]
This could easily be one page. I would remove the irrelevant hockey camp experience and all of the volunteer experience.
Make less blurry
"Hi! HR consultant and Resume writer here. Here are the things that catch my eye right off the batt: 
1. With not even being out of school yet there is no reason for your resume to be more than one page. My recommendation is to get rid of the extracurricular section all together. 
2. Move your skills to the very top. This is the most important information I want to know about a candidate - do you have the skills to do the job
3. I would reword some of your statements to be more direct and less wordy."
"WARNING! You were the one who said ROAST!

As a resume writer, I have to say, this resume is quite the puzzle! It's like trying to put together a jigsaw without the picture on the box. Let's start with the education section, shall we? A 4.0 GPA is impressive, but listing every single class you took is just overkill. The same goes for the AP classes, they're nice to have but they don't really add much value to this resume.

Moving on to the work experience section, it's great that you have experience teaching chess and Hebrew, but it would be even better if you could give some specific examples of how you impacted the children's learning. Also, it's not entirely clear how the chess and Hebrew teaching roles are related to computer engineering.

The leadership experience section is a bit of a mixed bag. It's great that you were captain of the wrestling team and vice-president of the chess club, but listing the high school name and the years you were in the club or team doesn't add much value. It would be more beneficial to list specific accomplishments or responsibilities you had in those roles.

The skills and interests section is where things get really interesting. It's impressive that you know so many coding languages and software, but listing them all without context doesn't really give the reader a sense of how you can use them. It's also great that you have hobbies and projects, but they don't really add much value to this resume.

Finally, the inclusion of your proficiency in Hebrew, English, Spanish, and Morse code is a nice touch, but it's not entirely clear how it's relevant to the job you're applying for.

Overall, while this resume has some good elements, it would benefit from a bit more focus and context. It's like a buffet of skills and experiences, but it's hard to know what dish to choose. So, this resume needs a bit of editing and re-organizing to make it more digestible for the reader"
Your work experience and leadership experience don't know what what tranferable skills you have that would apply in computer science/engineering at all.
Your resume isn’t your life’s biography. This doesn’t even remotely give an idea of what job you want to do
"Not sure what you are doing for your projects section. Each entry should clearly show the name of the project or imply the purpose of the project, not ""Excel"", ""Python"", ""Automation"", etc""Excel"", ""Python"", ""Automation"", etc"
"It's hard to see your skills and awards so move the content from the right side and place it below Projects.  Also, consider adding your contact number, address, and email under your name. Your resume text appears blurry. I noticed you are using the word ""spearheaded"" repeatedly, consider using a different word."
"*Font looks small, might be because of the screenshot
* Too many  entries in experience and projects. Should eliminate some to allow more room for those that remain. Quality, not quantity.

Education

* Would include start and end dates of the masters and bachelor for consistancy with experience section
* Not sure specifying the dollar amount inthe scholarships is relevant. I would cut that unless its there for a specific reason.

Employment Experience

* Would remove the bolded words in your bullet point entries. Too many are used and it reduces the visual clarity, especially since your headers are all bolded.
* Inclusion of numbers like 99% or numbers that are in clean increments of 5% or 10% or similar are immediately suspicious. Real life data is often not this clean. You should represent the true values rather than a rounded/approximate value.

Data Analyst 1

* ""Analyzed and interpreted institutional data using advanced Excel functions"" Kinda vague. What data, what functions? How did you handle the data?
* ""with 99% accuracy"", ""30% increase in user engagement"", ""25% improvement"" are too clean of values. Additionally, these metrics should be better contextualized. 
* Second bullet point has 2 sentences, either combine into a single sentence or split into two different bullet points for consistancy

Data Analyst 2

* ""enhancing data quality"" What does this mean? What data? How did you enhance it? 

Production Analyst

* ""through critical chain theory and statistical analysis."" There is something interesting here but you need to elaborate on it. Currently way too vague
* ""Conducted an optimization analysis"" See above bullet point
* Second bullet point has 2 sentences, either combine into a single sentence or split into two different bullet points for consistancy


Research Analyst

* ""Analyzed fretting wear data"" How did you analyze it? 
* ""Built an SVM model"" can elaborate more here


Key Projects

* Numbers for these entries are suspiciously in increments of 5% or 10%. 
* Wont go into these projects but should either be elaborated on more or cut to make room for other entries.

Technical Skills

* Remove all skills not relevant to the positionyou are applying for.

Certifications

* Each bullet point should be its own line. Could use double column here but would try to avoid that if possible.
* Only include certification if relevant to the role you are applying for"
"What sort of roles are you applying to? I actually think I am in a similar boat to you (data analyst / scientist) and have always wondered about specific metrics being included as part of a resume. For example, the 99.5% accuracy you quote for one of your projects seems really high (especially in the realm of patient health). Also, handling data with 99% accuracy in your most recent role seems a little vague, how was the data handled?  I appreciate you are quantifying your achievements but hard to tell if it actually means much."
Can you customize the shortened URLs so it’s friendlier to read and easier to type for those weary of clicking links
"Your resume is pretty goood. Well-formatted, ATS-friendly, and you have included some statistics / achievements in your bullet points as opposed to just stuff that you did. I'd add a summary section up the top (looks like this is the 2nd and third page of your resume? Try keep it to 2 pages if you can, unless you are some big executive or something). 

If this isn't working, could you link me the jobs you are trying to apply for or similar? I want to see how tailored your application is to the job post and see if there's any room for improvement. It's likely super competitive, but if you send me those links, it will give me a better idea."
"Hi, here are some suggestions to improve readability:

Increase margins to create more white space around the text.
Use a larger font size between 10 and 12 points for the body text.
Stick to black text for the main body of the resume.
Use bolding sparingly to highlight important section headers.

Also other areas for improvements: 

Content:

The experience section lists several short-term positions. While it’s great to demonstrate a variety of skills, consider emphasizing the most relevant experience for the specific job you are applying for.

The project descriptions are lengthy Focus on the most impactful achievements and quantify them whenever possible. For instance, instead of saying “Designed and implemented a platform for listing vending machines,” you could say “Developed an e-commerce platform that increased vending machine listings by 20%”.

The “Skills” section lists a wide range of programming languages and technologies. It would be stronger to prioritize the most relevant skills based on the job description.

Here are some additional tips:

Summary Statement: Add a summary statement at the top of the resume to highlight your most relevant skills and experience.

Tailoring: Tailor the resume to each specific job you apply for by incorporating keywords and achievements from the job description."
"It’s so perfect that HR departments won’t know how to respond to you, so you’ll be left on read and never get a job. Oh wait, that’s because they threw it in the trash.

(I don’t think I understood the assignment)"
Looks good overall. Remove one bullet from the first experience. Integrate more of the skills and certification into the rest of the resume. It should get you to a page
Set oven temp to 350 degrees. Let cook until golden brown. Enjoy
"Is the left column for your contact details, which is why it's blank? It's a little bit wasteful of space on your CV which could be better used with valuable content selling yourself for your dream job. 

Don't worry how ""pretty"" it is, unless you're applying to be an illustrator/graphic designer. Focus on ensuring all your achievements, strengths and key attributes are in the CV. 

  
Your intro/summary could be more specific. Do you have a degree/advanced degree? ie a Masters in Computing... add detail that sells your experience and differentiates you from others. Are you self-taught? Do you participate in extracurricular activites to self-develop faster? Do you have a side hustle? Is there an incredible project you've worked on? It currently reads as if it could belong to any React Developer. The point of the summary is to give a really good intro/overview of specifically you and to tease the hiring manager into wanting to read more of the CV.  I should be able to read it and pretty much know whether I want to interview you"
"Remove the left column, it should all be single column.

Remove the profile summary

the first bullet should be like a generalized description of what you do that even a toddler or a tech illiterate grandparent could understand, AKA a recruiter

Every other bullet needs to be a brag or a keyword 

You need your skills to be backed into those bullets.

Source: I am a recruiter / Career coach VTuber and I have recruiter heavily for IT."
"Remove that left section and just include at the top without any fancy colors, put employment history above skills, and include success metrics in your job bullets."
Your comments is much appreciated
"I would take out schools and internships in graphic design to put more focus on relevant experience.

Your experience is fine for an entry-level role, you should apply more."
"Education

* Not too sure what the other two school entries are and how they are relevant to you. If it is highschool or similar, I would remove it. You are at the point in your life where your university degree superscedes a high school degree. 

Experience

* Bullet points are all very vague and do not provide meaningful details on your contributions and the effects of those contributions. Format should be somethjing like ""I used X to do Y, resulting in Z"" where Z is some sort of quantifiable metric.


Projects

* See experience section
* Remove some projects that are less relevant to the role you are applying for. Use the saved space to elaborate more on other entries.

Technical Skills

* Remove skills  unlreated to the position you are applying for.
* Move relevant coursework to be under your college entry in Education


Achivements

* Remove AISSCE and AISSE award bullet point if it is highschool or similar
* Hackathon bullet point should be moved over to relevant project in Projects section
* Kaggle certification should be in new section called Certifications. PReferably include other relevant certifications in the new section"
"Zero effort resume. Your resume doesnt have any impactful experience and is not at all impressive for a BTech degree holder. It looks like this resume is made by a 5th grader. Are you sure you are aware of the tech market?

You should re-write all the points. 
Example, for your Python Developer Intern, you can describe it as “Developed automated data scraper using selenium to &lt;why was it useful or what was the impact to the company/team&gt;”.

Remove high school education- no one cares.

Check out other resumes in this sub and learn from them."
"You could fit this on one page for sure, I would recommend that for sure"
"Remove blue font, use only black. Remove verticle lines, I don't think ATS likes them. It hates anything unusual. 

The first set of bullet points don't mean much since they're not connected to anything. If you want a summary, make it a paragraph, 3-5 lines, and short sentences. 

Since you'll be changing the top, you'll have extra room and add more to the experience. 

Remove the titles on the right side and put one in the summary that matches the job you're applying for."
"-make sure it is ATS friendly
-cut down to one page, prioritize want you WANT recruiters to see
-prioritize technical skills over soft skills
-check spacing for consistency
-I would prioritize actual experience over professional summary, make your resume the highlights of your career!
-prior jobs should use past tense, current jobs should use present tense (and be consistent!)"
"Your resume is actually pretty good at first glance. You included a lot of of the things that you achieved whilst in the job. The biggest issue here is not going to be your resume but the fact you are going into a new sector without that specific banking experience is what's going to make job search difficult.

  
There's honestly not much you can do besides keep applying. If I'm going to be completely honest, it's going to be a struggle until you have at least 1-2 years of work experience.

  
One small thing I'd change on your resume is the education section and put it on the last part of your resume and the experience is the most important part and should always be far up as possible. The professional summary is good but needs some spaces as it's all clumped together.

One thing I'd consider changing is the resume sections. There is a blue rectangle for each section, is this just highlighted? If so, that's fine as long it's not an object as that will not make it ATS-friendly (if you don't know what this is search it up as it's super crucial)

It's a tough spot to be in, I've been there multiple times. If you want, send a link of the jobs that you're applying for so I can give you some more specific and actionable insights."
What do you mean by batch applying? Do you use any tools or paid subscription?
I suggest you put your metrics earlier on each of your bullet points by doing that you need to use the verb-metric-method strategy in reconstructing your bullet points. Our goal is to bring the metrics far left (near bullet points). This will help recruiters to see your metrics easily
This could be one page imo
Loyalty Fraud Detector 🤨👀
"Professional Summary

* Dont recommend including unless you are able to write it in a way that adds color to your resume in a manner that is unique and portrays you as especially well fit for the role you are applying for. Your current iteration is not sufficient in that regard and should either be rewritten or removed.\

Experience 

* Not too sure how i feel about the ""bullet point topic"" you have for each bullet point. Seems needlessly additive and redundant since the content of the bullet point does the same thing.
* The metrics you utilize are oddly exact. If you are going to include metrics, you should be as precise as possible when reporting it on your resume. Real life changes do not increase by increments of 5%.

Product Manager 


* ""implementing new onboarding frameworks and a library of pre-built templates and customer success playbooks for tailored guidance and reduced setup time."" Run on sentence. I understand what you were trying to say but it reads poorly.


Product Analyst (Project)

* ""Developed a predictive analytics model"" How did you do this? What language, technologies, etc. were used?
* ""Achieved a 15% improvement"" How did your analytics model achieve this?
* ""achieving a 30% reduction in time to milestones"" How did you come about this number? Compared to what?


Strategy and Transformation Intern

* ""Utilized analytics"" What analytics were used?
* ""to reduce customer support inquiries related to navigation by 15%."" Cap.
* ""leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques"" Such as? Can expand on this some more.


Product Manager

* ""Generated ~20% increase..."" Use the exact percentage. Dont be vague about the percent increase.
    * The tilde looks weird. Either use a different font for the tilde or find some other way to have it appear properly.
* ""executing new product initiatives"" WHat product initiatives? 
* ""effectively reducing drop-off rates"" By what amount?

* No real information provided. Either delete or expand.

"Here’s my thoughts:
Get rid of BIO. That leaves room to focus more on accomplishments and add more of them. If you applied they can assume those things about you and why it’s wasted space. Think of your resume as a piece of land. How would you maximize your yield from crops on land? Use it strategically to focus on what’s important and make certain assumptions about the reader. In this case, they can assume those things about you and confirm at interview. 
Change highlights to accomplishments. Accomplishments &gt; Highlights.

Hello! I am a resume writer and happy to help!
"Hi here are some tips:

1. **Quantify Achievements:**
   - Add specific numbers to your accomplishments (e.g., ""% increase in engagement,"" ""managed $X budget"").

2. **Organize Skills:**
   - Group skills into categories (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication Skills) and tailor them to the job.

3. **Improve Readability:**
   - Use consistent bullet points, concise statements, and highlight key achievements with bold or italics. Reduce redundancy in job titles."

"-Move contact, Ed, and skills to main section so it isn’t two columns - will save tons of space. Also choose a format that is ATS friendly.

-delete professional summary - all that info should be covered in experience

-you have a lot of experience, but even with that it should be a max of two pages. Condense your bullet points, way too many per section (prioritize main things you want them to see)"

"Overall, this is a great resume! Some minor things would be to include your GPA, and include the month of your graduation (so employers know exactly when you will be graduating). Also IMO you can take out the ""expected"". I think that's implied since.... it is not 2027 lol. Also try to quantify or at least describe the results of your work where possible, talk about the impact you had on the project/ company/ team. 

Best of luck!"
"Use a single column text resume if you're applying online. Google Jake's resume and use the template there.

Summary section should be limited to two lines. First line should be about your industry, experience and domain and the second line should be about your best achievement.

Work experience points, I'd recommend this format - 'What you did + How you did + End result'. Quantify the results. Ensure that each bullet tells its own complete story.

Regarding the work experience part, since it's within the same company, you can avoid mentioning your block chain experience if you think it's a hindrance. Just show your java developer experience. If you got a promotion there, you could show the growth as well.

You can get rid of your internship experience since it wouldn't matter much at your current experience level.

Good luck!"
"Roast isn't necessary, but I have some criticisms that might lead to improvements.

Tech skills - I want some context. Consider adding YOE or some subjective label for the level of mastery (not sure what people use but something like beginner/proficient/advanced).  Best would be explaining the types of problems you've solved with each technology.

Soft skills: wow, do I hate a list of buzzword soft skills with zero context. Don't tell me ""good communications"" because that could mean ""i txt my fr3ndz alot"" or ""I facilitate 10+ meetings weekly with audiences from project teams to senior leadership to public forums of 50+ people"". Don't tell me the name of a skill - instead, be specific about how you use the skill. 

The education section is a lot of lost real estate where you could be covering what you actually learned. Seriously I'm snoozing with your teacher's pet awards (ok, slight roast there). Combine most of that crap so there are no exact duplicate lines - X college, dual degree program with Y graduation date. Two lines for the two majors. One line listing the number of quarters you made the honor list. Then for each major have a line listing the key classes you took. This is where you cherry pick your classes to include words that relate to common job description words. This section gets you through an ATS screening if you do it right.

Good luck!"
"Zero numbers, statistics or tangible results. Backup every statement you make with proof.

""Kept offline file system highly organized and quickly retrieved needed records""

Organized in what fashion? Alphabetical order? How quickly did you retrieve them? 5 minutes, 5 weeks?

You talk of doing data analytics but there is literally no data in there to analyse.

I really dislike the format used as well. It's clean but it's not easy on the eye to read. The indents from one section to another, although might technically be correct, are hard to read. There is a template in the sidebar you can use.

This is a 1 page resume on 2 pages. Reduce it down."
"Your experience as an office admin reads like a list of generic responsibilities that you would have been expected to do at any job. Why do any of those things matter?

Try to focus on accomplishments and outcomes."
not sure what’s your point but there’s literally nothing to roast
"Hey OP! Here’s my ideas on your resume:

- Not ATS friendly. Check out resume that will surely pass the ATS usually they have single column and without any complex elements. This thing will increase accuracy of ATS when parsing.

- No one will read lengthy paragraphs in your profile experience. You should try to cut them into shorter bullet points aiming for 1-2 liner. This way, readers/recruiters can read your experience faster and easily understood.

Hope this helps :)"
"I would say: 

- make different parts more visible (e.g. bold or text bigger the dates, but not other parts too), so you can see different text sizes when you look at it zoomed out - this will bring out clarity, so the recruiter can have a better overview and it will look simple, yet better

- you may add your interests, but I think it's more important to add another soft and hard skills, some of them you can link to any experience - this will compensate for that you don't have that much work history (and it's definitely not expected to be otherwise). 

- compress your sentences - e.g. ""My job was to assemble the desserts"" -&gt; ""Dessert assembling"" 

- keep your personal info to what's shown right now, share as much as you want, but never too much (phone, email and city is okay) 

- try to highlight your education, because of these outstanding marks

**optional** (keeping this format is also great, as I can see what field you are going for):

- maaybe go on canva or some other website where you can download and customize your CV with more features, just to improvise and see how it can look, so you keep being inspired

- maaybe go on LinkedIn or other jobboard websites? 

**extra advice:** And I think this is probably the most important: Don't look for these sales and catering jobs, if you don't want them/ don't stay too long there. Of course, do it, if you actually want to gain experience in these fields, I appreciate that. But I think that the problem here is generally, that we cannot see any of your Computer, Gaming, Mathematics, Physics etc. related work.

Saying this, excuse me if I'm wrong, but don't be scared to dive deep in what you love and start literally anything, but strongly related to your interest (probably Game design?) Start as an intern somewhere, do another volunteership, start as a junior programmer or even Customer support in the Gaming industry. Whatever it is, for how long you want. Just to step in and to be able to say: I did this there, been there done that, that's why I am in this and I have potential for it.

"First, I would remove any PII. 

Second, look at the wiki and make a solid attempt and making a resume. 

Then post that here for help if needed."
In the experience it is too like packed. Separate stuff by bolding the most important parts of the bullet pts

"If you’re cold applying you might want to tailor your resume to their job description using the same words. No color. One page. Look up the ATS and how to format to tailor it. Also, remember impact impact impact. Every bullet should answer the question, so what? And add numbers."
1 page is the standard now
"The formatting will not make it through the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that the majority of companies now use. 

At minimum, remove the columns and change to a simple, basic font. That should help. 

ATS looks for keyword matches between the job duties/skills wanted and your resume content.  Look through this sub and you’ll see information on how to structure a resume to at least get through the electronic screening phase of application review. 

Hope this helped. Good luck!"
"Hi, here are some suggestions: 

# 1. Add a ""Key Achievements"" Section:

Create a ""Key Achievements"" section at the top to highlight major awards, grants, and research contributions for quick visibility.

# 2. Use Quantifiable Metrics:

Add numerical data (percentages, numbers) to showcase your impact, e.g., ""Improved efficiency by 30%"" to provide measurable value.

# 3. Group Related Research Experiences:

Organize similar research projects under common headers like ""Bioinformatics"" or ""Molecular Biology"" for improved readability.

# 4. Specify Skill Proficiency Levels:

Indicate proficiency levels for skills (e.g., Advanced Python, Intermediate MATLAB) to clearly communicate your expertise."
"I think you have all the parts but your ""CV"" still reads like a weird combination of CV and resume toe me. 

To me the difference between a CV and a resume is that a CV gets straight to the point and there is no... for the lack of a better word... BS. In my CV, I never describe the list of my exprience. If I went to a conference, I just state the name, date, location of the conference and my paper title. If I got a grant, I list the title of the grant, and done. If I got an award, I list the award name and the date. My research is separated into published (might not be applicable to you), working papers (ready to be read by others, you should have a personal website where your papers are posted there), and work-in-progress (rough ideas and rough drafts that are not ready for public yet). My research interest section lists probably 5 keywords, not sentences. This is because I have a separate research statement (you should have one regardless). 

Now that I'm on the other side (hiring), I also value CVs that get to the point. I am reviewing hundreds of applications in a day during hiring season, so even if I see long beautifully written sentences in a CV I still wouldn't know how beautiful, because I skip them. Sometimes if parts of a CV read like unnecessary fluff to me, I skip their entire application packet assuming they have nothing else valuable to say. It sounds harsh but if you're aiming for top programs, the last thing you want to do is to make the review committee feel like their time is wasted reading your CV.

Plus, you have a cover letter to elaborate on your CV. If your CV is attractive enough, they will read your cover letter. You can go into more detail in your accomplishments and goals there.

Just my 2 cents. BTW I am also not in bioengineering so YMMV.

As for good resources for good CVs, just go to the websites of top researchers in your field, download their CVs and copy their format."
"Hey! I think I have an idea.

1. Make this resume 1 column. 2 columns are bit hard to track for recruiters and ATS. 
2. Make sure all of your bullet points start with an action verb.

"I don’t see an education or certification section. It took me two seconds to stop reading. Total experience is less than two years.

"Your professional summary needs optimizing. It's not just about your past; it's your ad for what's next. Keep it concise, impactful, and tailored to the job you want. It's like the billboard of your resume, so make it count!"
These are like all Air Force jobs? Can you group them together? It looks like you have had 400 different jobs.
"**Initial thoughts**

 *  Make one column
 *  Remove skill progress bars
 *  Remove unnecessary details in bullet points so it can be one page
* remove profile replace with one sentence saying what job you'd like
* replace all paragraphs with 2-3 bullet points instead"
"You have not had much success for the last two months since the job market shuts down fro november until late jan to mid feb.

You can make this longer than one page probably 1.5 pages ish, your lead bullets under each job should be a generlized description of what you do so non-technical people (AKA Recruiters) understand it and the data analyst and biz dev role do not have dates by it, but otherwise its not a bad resume."

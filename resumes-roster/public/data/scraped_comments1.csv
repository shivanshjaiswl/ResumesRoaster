I've noticed a few things about your resume that could use improvement. It's missing key points that set you apart from others in your field:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/8mfiea/my_2018_resume_roast_it_please_urgent_help_please/,"Hi! Your resume is not detailed enough at all. it looks like you have focused a lot on the design which is nice, but you definitely need more on what your roles have been and what you can add to a company."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/8mfiea/my_2018_resume_roast_it_please_urgent_help_please/,"Ok, taking a crack at it:

First of all, the “hello“ in the “about“ section is redundant and should be removed. That will free up space for more relevant data and just overall make the resume more professional-looking. Also, I assume that the blacked out box in the “about“ section is your name. You can also remove that, as it is redundant.

Unless a picture on your resume is standard for your industry, which in this case I don’t think it is, then don’t put it. It can cause unconscious discrimination either for or against you, and it’s not worth taking the chance.

I’d say if you’re going to keep the title in, then you should tailor it to what types of jobs you’re looking for. But also I think that it’s fine without the title as well.

Additionally, I worry that the way your “about” section is worded implies that you may only be considering these jobs as temporary until your e-commerce platform gets off the ground. That may be true, but not something you necessarily want to broadcast to a potential employer. Try keeping it about your short-term goals to imply that you are legitimately interested in the position you’re applying for, because otherwise I worry how it will be viewed by employers.

And finally, while visually I like the design, and agree that it is a good format for graphic design positions, it would likely be an ATS nightmare, which might make things difficult for you when looking for office administrator positions. If you really like the design, I would suggest at the very least combining the languages and skills parts (you should not be devoting that much space to one single language fluency which, if you’re in America, is likely expected of you). Then move the skills section to the right side, and the education section to the bottom of the left side, and then use the additional space to flesh out the descriptions under your experience, as well as to adjust your “about” section.

That’s all I’ve got for now, I hope it’s helpful! Feel free to ask any questions!"

* Every bullet point needs to be in past tense, even if you are still working there. 
* It's been a bit since I recruited for this particular position but I don't see any keywords that would help me with the exception of the 5th bullet as that is a solid one with good keywords. 
* Your bullet points need to be rewritten with keywords in mind. You need to have more bullets like the 5th one, as that is solid, but you do need to write the result of what you do. WHAT the skill is, HOW you used it, and what the RESULT of it was.

- Since you're switching careers in a sense, add relevant coursework to possibly hit some keywords

- Experience section to top, though if you have good courses maybe experiment with having Education on top?

- Listing OSs isn't really skills. What did you do within each OS - did you setup AD within windows, spun up Linux Kubernetes Clusters, etc?

- Same with AWS and Azure, each of them of have hundreds of services, which ones do you know and have worked with?

- For projects, get rid of the ""Description"" and just give a couple bullet points on what you did, reduce adjectives a little here as well (""precise penetration tests..."",""diverse threat vectors""). Some are good, but in this scenario, there are too many IMO, and it detracts from what you did/learned.

In addition, when you get to 2 years' experience, MeetLeet will [write your technical resume for free](https://signup.meetleet.com/).

The specific feedback that resume parsing companies would have for your resume would be:

* Single column only, please
* No photo
* Delete 'achievements / tasks' - that will gum up the parsers
* Use the actual title you had, not 'internship'  


My advice would be:

* Use more numbers to quantify what you did - 'function in a smooth manner' is good, but 'function with 27% less downtime' would be better
* Change your professional headline from 'Software Engineer Student' to 'Junior Software Engineer' - you've shipped code to production, welcome to the profession! :)

• Your resume is missing out on the opportunity to demonstrate your success in metrics. Each bullet should be constructed with a success verb and a specific numerical accomplishment in your field or role. This entices potential interviewers by providing quantified, proven results and captures you as an achiever rather than just a doer.

• The verbs in your resume should be strengthened to success verbs. A success verb is stronger than an active verb - active verbs can be neutral in their depiction of your achievements. Active verbs to avoid include managed, had responsibility for, maintained, hired to, etc. Ideally, a resume bullet point never begins with these. In each case, you want to improve the quality of the bullet by upgrading the verb to a success verb. Words like accelerated, decreased, exceeded, maximized, and optimized help recruiters perceive you as someone who gets things done and creates real, measurable change.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1dxj82u/roast_my_resume/,"I would say: 

- make different parts more visible (e.g. bold or text bigger the dates, but not other parts too), so you can see different text sizes when you look at it zoomed out - this will bring out clarity, so the recruiter can have a better overview and it will look simple, yet better

- you may add your interests, but I think it's more important to add another soft and hard skills, some of them you can link to any experience - this will compensate for that you don't have that much work history (and it's definitely not expected to be otherwise). 

- compress your sentences - e.g. ""My job was to assemble the desserts"" -&gt; ""Dessert assembling"" 

- keep your personal info to what's shown right now, share as much as you want, but never too much (phone, email and city is okay) 

- try to highlight your education, because of these outstanding marks

**optional** (keeping this format is also great, as I can see what field you are going for):

- maaybe go on canva or some other website where you can download and customize your CV with more features, just to improvise and see how it can look, so you keep being inspired

- maaybe go on LinkedIn or other jobboard websites? 

**extra advice:** And I think this is probably the most important: Don't look for these sales and catering jobs, if you don't want them/ don't stay too long there. Of course, do it, if you actually want to gain experience in these fields, I appreciate that. But I think that the problem here is generally, that we cannot see any of your Computer, Gaming, Mathematics, Physics etc. related work.

Saying this, excuse me if I'm wrong, but don't be scared to dive deep in what you love and start literally anything, but strongly related to your interest (probably Game design?) Start as an intern somewhere, do another volunteership, start as a junior programmer or even Customer support in the Gaming industry. Whatever it is, for how long you want.

Experience (Current job on top to last relevant job)

Trim the fat in your resume, unless you are a decorated professional with extensive experience, I think limiting to a one pager is a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of job do you want? Do research and tailor your experience and skills to fit the mold for that position. Start with that kind of stuff. If you want to post an update. I'll be glad to readdress."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/y4oo9k/transitioning_teacher_to_curriculum_design_resume/,"I’m wondering if the “Early and Middle Childhood Literacy *Certification*” belongs in Education or down below in Certifications (other thought was to combine these two sections - it could work for Education field I think)? Or based on the description even Experience? If keeping it in that Education section since it has the most recent date, it would go at the top of that section. I have also always put education/certification at the beginning instead of the end of the resume (education specific from what I remember)

Personally I like [this resource](https://www.wilson.edu/sites/default/files/uploaded/WilsonTeacherResumepacket.pdf) for education specific resumes and some of the transferable skills/ action verbs / buzz words suggested could be helpful here to help give some parts of your resume a facelift. There are some things that could for sure benefit from wordsmithing to read more fluidly. 

For example under Substitute with the bullet starting with “Integrate.” You use impactful and impact in the same sentence. By integrating I think it’s assumed you chose the technology - maybe? And the flow of that sentence (try reading out loud to yourself) has a lot of words without a lot of meaning. Did the technology tools relate to ISTE standards? How did it impact learning/engagement? Increase it, decrease it, maintain it? Was there a learning management system involved (curriculum designers use that ALL the time) or any subscriptions to tech tools you needed to manage that would be relevant? Just food for thought here to help!!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1e4mdcq/roast_thy_resume_please_send_help/,"Hi here are some tips:

1. **Quantify Achievements:**
   - Add specific numbers to your accomplishments (e.g., ""% increase in engagement,"" ""managed $X budget"").

2. **Organize Skills:**
   - Group skills into categories (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication Skills) and tailor them to the job.

3. **Improve Readability:**
   - Use consistent bullet points, concise statements, and highlight key achievements with bold or italics. Reduce redundancy in job titles."

The other volunteering/freelancing is kinda odd - “other” makes it sound less important, I’d give it an umbrella term like “Brand Content Creator” or “Social Media Manager” and list each point below it not as a different “job”

This isn't going to be a roast as this a great resume, and you obviously seem very knowledgeable, but I do have a couple ideas that come to mind! I'm not too fluent in CS lingo, but my major is in engineering and I have accumulated experience in resumes.

First of all, it's really good that this only one A4. However, it is a bit crowded. The more effective you can make the reading experience, the better.

On general layout: if you're comfortable with it, add a friendly photo of yourself. That's an instant likability &amp; memorability boost. Also on the order of the main subjects: you want this to reflect the priorities in terms of if the reader won't be taking a long read. My current resume is in two columns, but the main one has this order: work experience – other experience (your projects) – education – interests. The work experience first because that's the environment the employee is going to find most common ground with. Also leave empty space, not excess, but let the layout breathe as my graphic design professor would say.

Throughout the resumes text bodies there are key words in bold, but there's quite a lot of both text and bold text, so nothing stands out efficiently. If you can, compress even further and shorten the descriptions. Cut all fluff out, it's going to end up diluting the value.

All in all, keep at it and you'll for sure get selected 😊"

- find people you know who are at companies with open roles where you want to work. Ask them to refer you.

- attend talks or webinars where the speaker works where you want to work. Reach out to them after the talk, compliment them and ask for a coffee chat. 

- if you apply to a role, find the manager or recruiter on LinkedIn or find their email on the website. Email them after you apply to say you're excited about the role and youd love to chat about it. You can sometimes even call the company and ask to speak to the hiring manager. 

- join online communities or attend conferences within your field and connect with people there.

Education

* Would include start and end dates of the masters and bachelor for consistancy with experience section
* Not sure specifying the dollar amount inthe scholarships is relevant. I would cut that unless its there for a specific reason.

Employment Experience

* Would remove the bolded words in your bullet point entries. Too many are used and it reduces the visual clarity, especially since your headers are all bolded.
* Inclusion of numbers like 99% or numbers that are in clean increments of 5% or 10% or similar are immediately suspicious. Real life data is often not this clean. You should represent the true values rather than a rounded/approximate value.

Data Analyst 1

* ""Analyzed and interpreted institutional data using advanced Excel functions"" Kinda vague. What data, what functions? How did you handle the data?
* ""with 99% accuracy"", ""30% increase in user engagement"", ""25% improvement"" are too clean of values. Additionally, these metrics should be better contextualized.

Data Analyst 2

* ""enhancing data quality"" What does this mean? What data? How did you enhance it?

* Second bullet point has 2 sentences, either combine into a single sentence or split into two different bullet points for consistancy


Research Analyst

* ""Analyzed fretting wear data"" How did you analyze it? 
* ""Built an SVM model"" can elaborate more here


Key Projects

* Numbers for these entries are suspiciously in increments of 5% or 10%. 
* Wont go into these projects but should either be elaborated on more or cut to make room for other entries.

Technical Skills

* Remove all skills not relevant to the positionyou are applying for.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1ebp1zk/roast_my_resume/,"Hi, here are some suggestions to improve readability:

Increase margins to create more white space around the text.
Use a larger font size between 10 and 12 points for the body text.
Stick to black text for the main body of the resume.
Use bolding sparingly to highlight important section headers.

Also other areas for improvements: 

Content:

The experience section lists several short-term positions. While it’s great to demonstrate a variety of skills, consider emphasizing the most relevant experience for the specific job you are applying for.

The project descriptions are lengthy Focus on the most impactful achievements and quantify them whenever possible. For instance, instead of saying “Designed and implemented a platform for listing vending machines,” you could say “Developed an e-commerce platform that increased vending machine listings by 20%”.

The “Skills” section lists a wide range of programming languages and technologies. It would be stronger to prioritize the most relevant skills based on the job description.

Here are some additional tips:

Summary Statement: Add a summary statement at the top of the resume to highlight your most relevant skills and experience.

Tailoring: Tailor the resume to each specific job you apply for by incorporating keywords and achievements from the job description."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/ftu68j/can_somebody_please_roast_me_being_in_furlong_and/,"Holy shit this had better not be your real resume. Be better. You are most definitely not cool enough for 2 pages, and no fucking paragraphs.  

So, we're starting over.  Write 2 resumes.  The first one is for humans to read and is written with that in mind. This is the one you email as a PDF and print out for interviews. 

The second one is basically a copy of the first one, but is formatted for robots.  Take all the words of your first resume, and then chop it up following the thousands of guides for beating the HR robots in the database game.  

Formatting rules don't matter to robots, so everything below applies to the first resume. If the robot resume slips over 2 pages, oh well, but it shouldn't be because you added more content that wasn't on the resume for Humans with a hard limit of 1 page.  

Formatting rules very much matter here. It should look [this.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sp84d6hmcnzc32e/Bro%27s%20Resume.docx?dl=0).  There is a ton of design choices here made with specific intent. 

Nearly every interview I've ever been on the people interviewing me didn't read anything about me until we sat down.  Their first question is almost always just reading the first thing they see on the resume.  So, I make sure that the first thing they see is the job title, not the company by having it centered, bolded, and surrounded by white space. The first bullet point is the first thing I want to talk about.  We'll spend the first 15 minutes on how I'm so awesome in that one role, then realize we're short on time then move onto the next job without any real questions then launch into how I was awesome at the next job on the list. 

Every bullet point is no longer than 2 lines.  Every line uses at least 75% of the space it has.  If you use one line and half of a second line, shorten it to one line or add more until it uses 75%.  If it goes over 3 lines you need to split the bullets. 

Every job has 3-5 bullets.  No more, no less, until you stop getting resume advice from Reddit.  Every bullet must have a number in 
it.  No words can be repeated within a bullet point and no two bullets can start with the same word.  This will force you to write better and follow most rules of grammar. 

One and only one can be a 'job description', which talks about what your responsibilities were.  That's ""Assisted the Business manager in running a $4m/yr business""

The next bullet should be a personal accomplishment.  ""Employee of the month 5 times"", ""Earned Food Safety Certification"", ""Got 5 gold stars and a free cookie"" something YOU did because YOU are so awesome at YOUR job.  

The last bullet should be a Team Accomplishment.  ""Store sales increased 10%"", ""Our restaurant voted #1 in the franchise network"", something the TEAM did while you were there, and why YOU helped make that happen. 

Bullets 4 &amp; 5 are up to two more Personal or Team accomplishments.  Then move on to the next job, following the same rules. 

Until you know better, write up your education as if it were a job, and follow the same rules.  Bold and center the degree or the school, whichever you think is more valuable. ""Job Description"" should describe the program and your senior classes, and the team and personal accomplishments should cover your coursework and extracurricular. 

EVERYTHING on this resume should focus on why YOU are AWESOME.  Do not admit any faults.  By all means, DO NOT LIE, but if they want dirt on you, make them go digging for it themselves. 

Common advice is to put education up top and list your jobs in chronological order.  Personally, I don't subscribe to that, because my GPA sucked and I'd spend the first 15 minutes digging myself out of a very deep hole.  When I started putting what I was most awesome at up top, and education at the bottom, companies would see my GPA and start making excuses FOR me because they were already sold."

* Professional summaries should be only utilized if you can highlight something unique to you that adds color to your resume and is relevant toteh position you are applying for. Current iteration does not do this. I would strongly consider rewriting or removing.
* Skills section should be a quick list of relevant skills to the position you are applying for.
* No need to specify the amount of time you were in the position for. Only include the start and end dates
* You bullet points seem to be an itemized list of your responsibilties. They should instead be used to show off your specific accomplishments and achievements. Utilize a format like ""I used X to do Y, resulting in Z"" or similar where  Z is some sort of quantifiable metric that shows off your specific impact on the  project/position.
* Bullet points are also fairly vague. You say things like ""Maintain average producuon goal above 95% consistently."" How did you do this? What tools/technologies/strategies were used to achieve this? These questions should be addresssed when you write bullet points for the positions"

* Bullet points are all very vague and do not provide meaningful details on your contributions and the effects of those contributions. Format should be somethjing like ""I used X to do Y, resulting in Z"" where Z is some sort of quantifiable metric.


Projects

* See experience section
* Remove some projects that are less relevant to the role you are applying for. Use the saved space to elaborate more on other entries.

Technical Skills

* Remove skills  unlreated to the position you are applying for.
* Move relevant coursework to be under your college entry in Education


Achivements

* Remove AISSCE and AISSE award bullet point if it is highschool or similar

https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1elrm6c/please_roast_and_review_my_resume_i_applied_for/,"Hi, here is some constructive feedback: 

	1.	Overloaded and Unreadable: The resume is packed with too much text, making it hard to read. Simplify and add more white space.

	2.	Repetitive Information: You mention the same skills and tools in multiple sections. This redundancy clutters the resume.

	3.	Lacks Prioritization: With so many projects and experiences listed, it’s difficult to see what’s most important. Focus on highlighting the most relevant work.

	4.	Formatting Problems: The inconsistent layout, varying bullet points, and section headers make it look unprofessional.

	5.	Jargon-Heavy Summary: Your professional summary is too long and full of jargon. Simplify it and highlight key strengths.

	6.	Inconsistent Acronyms: Define acronyms when first used and stick with them throughout.

	7.	Disorganized Experience Section: This section blends project details with job duties, making it hard to follow. Separate and clarify these points.

	8.	Confusing Education Timeline: The overlapping dates of your Master’s program and recent work experience are unclear. Clarify this to avoid confusion.

	9.	Overly Technical Projects: The research and projects sections are too detailed. Summarize the outcomes and impact instead of listing every technology.

	10.	Not Tailored: The resume feels generic. Customize it for the specific job you’re applying for to make a better impression.

-Overall: get rid of the second page, that emergency real estate because you should aim for a one page resume. If they want to learn about your projects they can use the Portfolio, LinkedIn, and GitHub links. When you’re rewriting the resume keep in mind that your goals are to get pass the ATS and HR people to get an interview with the actual subject matter experts who will understand your expertise. 

Professional Summary: rewrite this section and think of it as a blurb to introduce yourself professionally. Imagine you ran into somebody who knew a hiring manager for your ideal job but they aren’t familiar with your field. What do you want them to say when they’re  talking about you? “Applied Scientist intern with 5+ years experience in…”. Now put your professional strengths/technical abilities and the value you’ve created for the organizations you’ve worked with. Leave off the parentheses containing how long you’ve done each thing, you can say that in the interview and free up some space. 

Research experience: for the completed research I would rewrite it to include a quantifiable value/insight you gained. For the ongoing research list the quantifiable goal you hope to reach or the quantifiable insight you’ve gained so far, whichever you think is more impressive. Keep the actual bullet summarizing the action you took simple and add an additional bullet to list the Tools/Technical Skills you used. 

Experience section: the data scientist/cloud engineer job is the strongest part but I would tweak everything. Remember you’re going to include a bullet point that lists your technical skills/tools you used for the entire job so you can make your actual job summary simpler to understand. It should be action took+problem solved+quantifiable value generated. 

Example: Lead the creation and deployment of automation bots to streamline email management and file download, resulting 10 man-hours saved weekly. 

For the above example I would suggest comparing the new business value generated by your action to the previous benchmark and presenting it as a percentage so it’s easier to understand for someone who doesn’t work in your field. So an example would be if before your bots were deployed it took 20 hours to manage the emails/file downloads. 

The bullet point would say:  Lead the creation and deployment of automation bots to streamline email management and file download, resulting in 50% reduction in man-hours."

Its.....not good. I am sorry. I found almost nothing I would need to move you forward as a full stack engineer. Your bolding is distracting and the only keyword I found was Kubernetes that is really a secondary keyword compared to what I want to see.

Not trying to be cruel but you will need to remake this from scratch using the following formula 

* Your first bullet under each job needs to be a summary of your duties that a 12 year old can understand, this is not a metaphor that is how basic you need your first sentence.
* Every other bullet needs to be a keyword and/or a brag, with keywords being more important. If it doesn’t have a keyword and/or brag, than it shouldn’t exist in your resume bullets.
   * Keywords are what the job description has under “qualifications”, “Must have” or “Needed Skills”. If 
   * Brags need to be understood by someone with no industry knowledge, and if you don’t have hard numbers you can use awards, or customer feedback, or results.
* Example of a good brag with keywords is “Used Excel to create a sales document for our team that was praised by my direct manager, for helping us sell more products.”
* WHAT the skill is, HOW you used it, and what the RESULT of it was

The keywords I would needed for a full stack position is going to be TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node, Angular, and another primary language such as Python, C, or Java."

- Under Education, is that “3.7” your GPA? If so, great job! However, companies don’t care very much about your GPA anymore, just whether you have experience &amp; “what makes you different compared to everyone else”. However, you can include “Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, etc” if you did qualify.

WARNING: We have noticed a recent uptick in spam for task sites like Taskrabbit or Fiverr. NEVER hire someone who directly messages you to solicit services based on your resume post. In-demand and high-quality resume writers do not need to seek out new business through farming r/resume. If you have any questions, feel free to DM the mods.
